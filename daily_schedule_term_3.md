### Week 9 &mdash; Continue Newton Proposition 11

Context: With the possible exception of Proposition 1 and Proposition 6, Corollary 1, upon which Proposition 11 directly depends, Proposition 11 is probably the single most important Proposition we have encountered. It was also composed of a lot of steps, many of which used special properties of ellipses. Why is this Proposition so important? Because Kepler has demonstrated, using Brahe's observations, that the planets go around the Sun in ellipses with the Sun at one focus, and they trace out equal areas in equal times. We know that equal areas in equal times implies a centripetal force. In Proposition 11, Newton shows that orbits of ellipses with the centripetal force originating from one focus necessitates an inverse square law for the force. He is going to show many more things, but with this, he could already close up shop and rest on his laurels. He has rigorously demonstrated in Proposition 11 what others have only conjectured: that the motion of the planets are caused by a centripetal force in the direction of the Sun, and that the strength of this force follows an inverse square law. Because of this Proposition's importance and difficulty, we must spend more time on it.

* Preparation for Tuesday, Nov. 1 &mdash; Do [Problem Set 5](./assignments/PS05.nb.pdf) on Properties of Ellipses &mdash; Read Chapters 4 and 5 of Gleick &mdash; Write out *your own version* of Proposition 11 (organize it as it makes sense to you, clearly demarcate results needed from other sources, and clearly identify steps that are required but do not understand &mdash; don't simply regurgitate Newton or Densmore even though you are depending on both of them for a full understanding!)
