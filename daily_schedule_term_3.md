### Week 10 &mdash; Continue Newton Proposition 11

Context: With the possible exception of Proposition 1 and Proposition 6, Corollary 1, upon which Proposition 11 directly depends, Proposition 11 is probably the single most important Proposition we have encountered. It was also composed of a lot of steps, many of which used special properties of ellipses.

Why is this Proposition so important? Because Kepler has demonstrated, using Brahe's observations, that the planets go around the Sun in ellipses with the Sun at one focus, and they trace out equal areas in equal times.

We know that for an orbit of any shape, equal areas in equal times implies a centripetal force. In Proposition 11, Newton shows that for ellipses with the centripetal force originating from one focus the force obeys an inverse square law. He is going to show many more things, but with this, he could already close up shop. He has rigorously demonstrated in Proposition 11 what others have only conjectured: that the motion of the planets are caused by a centripetal force in the direction of the Sun, and that the strength of this force follows an inverse square law. Because of this Proposition's importance and difficulty, we must spend more time on it.

* Preparation for Tuesday, Nov. 8 &mdash; Write out *your own version* of Proposition 11 (organize it as it makes sense to you, clearly demarcate results needed from other sources, and clearly identify steps that are required but do not understand &mdash; don't simply regurgitate Newton or Densmore even though you are depending on both of them for a full understanding!)
* Thursday, Nov. 10 &mdash; Write out your own version of Proposition 13 (we are skipping Proposition 12)
* For Friday, Nov. 11 &mdash; Gleick through Chapter 10

### Week 11 &mdash; Newton Propositions 13 to 16 &mdash; Book III: The 4 Rules of Philosophizing

More Context: Proposition 11 is for ellipses, Proposition 12 is for hyperbolas, and Proposition 13 is for parabolas. All three come to the conclusion that an inverse square law force is causing the observed motion. Parabolas are important because the very long-period comets seem to follow parabolas. Hyperbolas describe extremely rare objects that pass once through our solar system, never to return. The first ever observed was [ʻOumuamua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ʻOumuamua).

* For Tuesday, Nov. 15 &mdash; [Apollonius Through Proposition 11](./resources/12MorePagesOfApollonius.pdf) &mdash; Focus on what is needed to understand Newton Proposition 13
* Tuesday, Nov. 15 &mdash; Frustratingly, different translations of Apollonius have different numbering &mdash; what is referred to as Proposition 11 in the translation by Densmore and Donahue is what we already new as Proposition 1 in the [Apollonius translation by Halley](./resources/12PagesOfApollonius.pdf)
* Problem Set 6, due in my box 9am, Thursday, Nov. 17 &mdash; Your write-up of Proposition 13: clearly delineate steps that you understand, what you must take on faith from other sources but nonetheless clearly understand the consequences of, and what you do not understand
* Preparation for Thursday Nov. 17 &mdash; Press on to Newton Propositions 14, 15, and 16
* Preparation for Friday, Nov. 18 &mdash; Skip Densmore's terse summary of Book II (we will return to it as needed and as she refers to it) &mdash; Read the 4 Rules of Philosophizing at the opening of Book III &mdash; Read [Barnard Chapter 1](./resources/ClaudeBernardChapter1.pdf) (provided by Luke)

### Week 12 &mdash; The Modern Treatment of Elliptical Orbits &mdash; Finish Book I &mdash; Book III: Begin The Phenomena

* Saturday, Nov. 19 &mdash; The modern calculus-based treatment of elliptical orbits in polar *(r, &theta;)* coordinates
* Sunday, Nov. 20 &mdash; Finish Book I (through Proposition 17)
* Preparation for Tuesday, Nov. 22 &mdash; Phenomena 1 (the moons of Jupiter) and 2 (the moons of Saturn) &mdash; Problem Set 7: choose an additional selection of moons of Jupiter and moons of Saturn, and extend Newton's tables in Phenomena 1 and 2
* Tuesday, Nov. 22 &mdash; Discuss Phenomena 1 and 2

### Week 13 &mdash; Book III: The Phenomena (Continued)

*Odd schedule this week due to Friday all-hands preg check*

* Monday, Nov. 29 &mdash; Continue the Phenomena
* Wednesday, Nov. 30 &mdash; Continue the Phenomena

*Mishel to choose Kuhn selection to augment this "philosophy Thursday:"

* Thursday, Dec. 1 &mdash; The prefatory General Scholium &mdash; Read [Barnard Chapter 2](./resources/ClaudeBernardChapter2.pdf) (provided by Luke)
