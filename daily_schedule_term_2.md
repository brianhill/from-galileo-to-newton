## From Galileo to Newton Daily Schedule Term 2

Course [home page](./)

As we proceed into Newton at the end of Week 2, it will be important for each of us to maintain a glossary which represents
our best understanding of terms used by Newton, as he uses them. Here is the beginning of [my glossary](./my_glossary.html).

### Week 1 &mdash; Euclid's Understanding of Ratios &mdash; Galileo's Understanding of Uniform Motion

* Preparation for Tuesday, Aug. 30 &mdash; In a footnote, you will see that Galileo relies upon Book V Definition 5 of Euclid regarding proportionality. Here is an image of the [first page of Book V](./resources/EuclidBookVDefinition5.jpeg). Read the first six definitions critically in tandem with reading the first three theorems. In addition to being prepared to discuss the reading, create example problems with numbers that illustrate what Galileo is saying. 2-3 problems on one page would be a good amount. I will step out and photocopy them. We will spend a bunch of class time solving a selection of each others' problems. In these problems try to avoid using *d = v t*. That is not how any of Euclid, Galileo, or Newton write. Instead, they write in terms of ratios. The illustrative problems you create to share with one another should therefore also be posed in terms of ratios.
* Tuesday, Aug. 30 &mdash; Euclid's Ratios &mdash; Begin Galileo's Uniform Motion &mdash; Some [Example Problems for Day 1](./examples/Day01Examples.pdf)
* Preparation for Thursday, Sep. 1 &mdash; Do the problems you prepared for one another on Theorems I to III &mdash; We won't hand those in, but we should discuss them &mdash; Read the remaining three theorems/propositions on Uniform Motion &mdash; Ben and Brian will present Theorem IV, Mishel and Sofia Theorem V, and Luke and Declan Theorem VI &mdash; A good idea would be to begin your presentation with an illustrative example including example units and numbers
* Thursday, Sep. 1 &mdash; Conclude Galileo's Uniform Motion &mdash; Ben and Brian's [Proof of Theorem IV](./proofs/Day02TheoremIV.pdf) (includes a summary of the first six theorems)

### Week 2 &mdash; Galileo's Understanding of Uniform Acceleration &mdash; Galilean Relativity &mdash; Begin Newton

* Preparation for Monday, Sep. 5 &mdash; Read Theorem I, Theorem II, and Corollary I (through p. 175) on uniform acceleration from [the second excerpt from Two New Sciences](./resources/DialoguesConcerningTwoNewSciences-Excerpt02.pdf)
* Preparation for Tuesday, Sep. 6 &mdash; Read Corollary II, Theorem III, and Theorem IV (through p. 187) on uniform acceleration from [the third excerpt from Two New Sciences](./resources/DialoguesConcerningTwoNewSciences-Excerpt03.pdf) &mdash; In addition, glance ahead to get a hint of where Galileo is going, even though we are about to part ways with *The Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences,* and especially glance at the very next theorem, Theorem V &mdash; Finally, in addition, read this excerpt from Galileo's [Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems](./resources/DialogueConcerningTheTwoChiefWorldSystems-Excerpt.pdf).
* NB/Context: *The Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems,* published in 1632 is the book that got Galileo on trial. It was banned in 1633 and not permitted to be published in Catholic countries until 1835. Galileo makes many arguments with the ultimate conclusions being that the Earth revolves daily, it is in motion around the Sun, and that the Sun and the Moon raise the tides. The specific argument we are reading is an argument for what is now known as Galilean Relativity. The idea is that you cannot detect if you are in uniform motion. This does not quite address either revolution around the Earth's axis or circular motion around the Sun, but it nonetheless goes a very long way toward explaining why we do not sense that we are hurtling through space at 67,000 miles per hour.
* We will now leave Galileo and turn to Newton, but in addition to your first Newton reading, you will have your [1st Problem Set](./assignments/PS01.nb.pdf) on Galileo due Thursday.
* Preparation for Thursday, Sep. 8 &mdash; In addition to doing the problem set on Newton, study pp. 5-19 of the Densmore edition of *The Principia.*
* Thursday, Sep. 8 &mdash; *Inherent force, aka inertia,* L. vis insita  &mdash; The need for [a glossary](./my_glossary.html) &mdash; Newton's Cannon (see Densmore pp. 14-15)
