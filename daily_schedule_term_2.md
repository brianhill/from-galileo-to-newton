## From Galileo to Newton Daily Schedule Term 2

Course [home page](./)

### Week 1

* Tuesday, Aug. 30 &mdash; Read pp. 153-160 from this excerpt from Galileo's [Two New Sciences](./resources/). You will see that Galileo has quite a clear and complete conceptualization of uniform velocity. In addition to discussing what Galileo wrote on those pages. Create problems with numbers that illustrate what Galileo is saying. 2-3 problems on one page would be a good amount. I will step out and photocopy them. We will spend a bunch of class time solving a selection of each others' problems. In these problems try to avoid using d = v * t. That is not how either Galileo or Newton write. They both write in terms of ratios, not equations. The illustrative problems you create to share with one another should also be posed in terms of ratios.
