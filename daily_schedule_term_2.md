## From Galileo to Newton Daily Schedule Term 2

Course [home page](./)

### Week 1 &mdash; Galileo's Understanding of Uniform Motion, Relativity, and Uniform and Uniform Acceleration &mdash; Euclid's Understanding of Ratios

* Preparation for Tuesday, Aug. 30 &mdash; Read the first three theorems/propositions from this excerpt from Galileo's [Two New Sciences](./resources/DialoguesConcerningTwoNewSciences-Excerpt01.pdf). In a footnote, you will see that Galileo relies upon Book V Definition 5 of Euclid wherein Euclid gets very precise about proportionality. Here is an image of the [first page of Book V](./resources/EuclidBookVDefinition5.jpeg). Read the first six definitions critically in tandem with reading the first three theorems. In addition to being prepared to discuss the reading, create example problems with numbers that illustrate what Galileo is saying. 2-3 problems on one page would be a good amount. I will step out and photocopy them. We will spend a bunch of class time solving a selection of each others' problems. In these problems try to avoid using *d&thinspace;=&thinspace;v&thinspace;t*. That is not how any of Euclid, Galileo, or Newton write. Instead, they write in terms of ratios. The illustrative problems you create to share with one another should therefore also be posed in terms of ratios.
* Tuesday, Aug. 30 &mdash; Euclid's ratios and Galileo's Uniform Motion &mdash; Some [Example Problems for Day 1](./examples/Day01Examples.pdf)
* Preparation for Thursday, Sep. 1 &mdash; Read the remaining three theorems/propositions on Uniform Motion. These are similar in spirit to the first three theorems so we won't spend as much time on them. As you did for the first class, create some example problems with actual numbers that illustrate what Galileo is saying, specifically in Theorems V and VI. Read this excerpt from Galileo's [Two Chief World Systems](./resources/DialogueConcerningTheTwoChiefWorldSystems-Excerpt.pdf). This is the book that got him on trial. He is arguing many things and concluding that the Earth revolves daily and is in motion around the Sun. The argument we are reading is what is now known as Galilean Relativity. The idea is that you cannot detect if you are in uniform motion. This does not quite address either revolution around the Earth's axis or circular motion around the Sun, but it is going a long way toward explaining why we aren't that why we are hurtling through space at 67,000 miles per hour.
* Thursday, Sep. 1 &mdash; Continue Uniform Motion &mdash; Galilean Relativity
* Preparation for Friday, Sep. 2
* Friday, Sep 2 &mdash; Galileo's Uniform Acceleration Results
