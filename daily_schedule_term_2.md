## From Galileo to Newton Daily Schedule Term 2

Course [home page](./)

### Week 1

* Tuesday, Aug. 30 &mdash; Read the first three theorems/propositions from this excerpt from Galileo's [Two New Sciences](./resources/DialoguesConcerningTwoNewSciences-Excerpt01.pdf). In a footnote, you will see that Galileo relies upon Book V Definition 5 of Euclid wherein Euclid gets very precise about proportionality. Here is an image of the [first page of Book V](./resources/EuclidBookVDefinition5.jpeg). Read the first six definitions critically in tandem with reading the first three theorems. In addition to being prepared to discuss the reading, create problems with numbers that illustrate what Galileo is saying. 2-3 problems on one page would be a good amount. I will step out and photocopy them. We will spend a bunch of class time solving a selection of each others' problems. In these problems try to avoid using *d&thinspace;=&thinspace;v&thinspace;t*. That is not how any of Euclid, Galileo, or Newton write. Instead, they write in terms of ratios. The illustrative problems you create to share with one another should therefore also be posed in terms of ratios.


Looking ahead: As we proceed in our *Two New Sciences* reading, you will see that Galileo has quite a rigorous and complete conceptualization of uniform velocity. He understands uniform acceleration equally well. A third thing from another discourse that he understands is what we now call Galilean relativity.
