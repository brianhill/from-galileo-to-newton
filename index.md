## What we Desire to Cover

* The backbone of our course is pp. 5-489 of [Newton's Principia: The Central Argument, 3rd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Newtons-Principia-Central-Argument-Translation/dp/1888009241) by Dana Densmore, with translations and diagrams by William H. Donahue. That is 485 pages of material, but do not be daunted by page-count alone. Newton himself is terse. In fact *The Principia* is an expansion of a mere-9-page document which Newton submitted in response to a challenge to prove that Kepler's Laws followed from an inverse-square law for gravitation. Only at most one-quarter of the material in Densmore is by Newton. The rest is Densmore's commentary. Assuming most of our 14 weeks together is occupied on this material, we have 35 to 44 pages of reading per week. *However,* there is additional material we must cover.
* Newton presumes an understanding of Galileo's *Two New Sciences,* of Euclid's *Elements,* and of Apollonius' *On Conic Sections.* We will therefore need to budget at least 2 of our 14 weeks to pick up something from those works. To be safe we will try to cover 45 pages per week when we are focused on Densmore. If we cannot maintain that pace, then we will simply not get to some of Newton's brilliant conclusions in Book III of the Principia. *I do not know yet* how much we will have to backtrack into Galileo, Euclid, and Apollonius. Perhaps, in the interest of time, we can take some of the results from their works on faith:
  * A 1914 translation of Galileo's [Two New Sciences](./resources/TwoNewSciences.pdf)
  * Euclid's *Elements* is in thirteen books. We only need results from the first six. The Gutenberg project has an 1885 translation of these six books of [The Elements](./resources/TheElements.pdf)
  * Apollonius' *On Conic Sections* is in seven books. We only need results from books one and three. A modern translation of [On Conic Sections](./resources/OnConicSections.pdf) by Boris Rosenfeld is available.
  
## Stuff It should not be Necessary to Say

Unfortunately, I have found that it is necessary to spell things like this out
even at the college level:

Do your work on 8 1/2 x 11 paper (not other screwball paper). No torn out pages from bound notebooks. Recopy if using pen or erase if using pencil so you don't have scratchouts.
