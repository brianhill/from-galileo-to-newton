## What we Desire to Cover

* The central argument of Newton's Principia is laid out on pp. 5-489 of [Densmore, 3rd edition](https://www.amazon.com/Newtons-Principia-Central-Argument-Translation/dp/1888009241). This is the backbone for our studies. That is 485 pages of material. Assuming most of our 14 weeks together is occupied on this material, that is 35 to 44 pages of dense reading per week. *However,* there is additional material we must cover.
* Newton presumes an understanding of Galileo's *Two New Sciences,* of Euclid's *Elements,* and of Apollonius' *On Conic Sections.* We will therefore need to budget at least 2 of our 14 weeks to pick up those essentials. To be safe we will try to cover 45 pages per week when we are focused on Densmore. If we cannot maintain that pace, then we will simply not get to some of Newton's brilliant conclusions in Book III of the Principia.
  * A 1914 translation of Galileo's [Two New Sciences](./resources/TwoNewSciences.pdf)
  * Euclid's *Elements* is in thirteen books. We only need results from the first six. The Gutenberg project has an 1885 translation of these six books of the [Elements](./resources/TheElements.pdf)
  * Apollonius' *On Conic Sections* is in seven books. We only need results from books one and three. A modern translation of [On Conic Sections](./resources/OnConicSections.pdf) by Boris Rosenfeld is available.
